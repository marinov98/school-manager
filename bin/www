// This will be our application entry. We'll setup our server here.
// Explanation so, basically it removes all the create and start server code from your app.js and let you focus only on the application logic part.

const http = require("http");
const app = require("../app"); // The express app we just created

const port = parseInt(process.env.PORT, 10) || 5000;
app.set("port", port);

const server = http.createServer(app);
server.listen(port);
